                   <p>The rivers of India play an important role in the lives of the Indian people. The river systems provide irrigation, potable water, cheap transportation, electricity, as well as provide livelihoods for a large number of people all over the country. This easily explains why nearly all the major cities of India are located by the banks of river. The rivers also have an important role in Hindu mythology and are considered holy by all Hindus in the country.</p>
                   <p>Seven major rivers (Indus, Brahmaputra, Narmada, Tapi, Godavari, Krishna and Mahanadi )along with their numerous tributaries make up the river system of India. Most of the rivers pour their waters into the Bay of Bengal.</p>

                    <p>Based on their source, the Indian River system is classified in to - Himalayan Rivers and Peninsular Rivers. </p>
                        <p>The Himalayan Rivers, as the name suggests originate from the Himalayas and flow through the Northern Plains. </p>

              <p>Peninsular River System or Peninsular Drainage emerges mainly from the Western Ghats. Since the Western Ghats form a ‘water divide’, these rivers either flow eastwards into the Bay of Bengal or into the Arabian Sea towards the west. Peninsular Rivers are basically ‘rain fed’ rivers.</p>
